# Foreword from the Chef

**Cooking is like doing Data Science**

You 
- start with raw ingredients (**messy data**)
- should make sure that the ingredients are fresh and good (**garbage in, garbage out**)
- clean and chop the ingredients (**preprocessing**)
- follow a recipe (**modelling pipeline**)
- should avoid adding too much salt (**overfitting**)
- may experiment with varying spices (**hyperparameter tuning**) 
- let friends taste your dish (**evaluation**)
- hope that even strangers will like it  (**generalization to new data**).

In this spirit, we - the Programming class of the Master Data Science at Fachhochschule Kiel - proudly presents: **THE DATA SCIENCE COOKBOOK**. Here, we will assemble our most loved (food!) recipes, in case we manage to beat the dangerous Git and Github monster. Let's see whether our cooking skills are on par with our data science skills.

Just to remind ourselves of good habits:

- When experimenting with risky ingredients, test it in a separate pot first (**git branch**). 
- Take repeatedly notes about all ingredients and cooking steps (**git commit**).  
- If you have added to much salt to your dish, you can either add some sugar on top to balance it out (**git revert**) or try to filter out the salt (**git reset**). But note: don't try to filter out the salt if you have already shared it with your friends (**shared on Github**) 
- As a matter of politeness, don't pour your sauce of the main dish without asking the Chef and your kitchen co-workers first (**pull request**).
- Let us know (**Github Issue**) if you would like to see more recipes (**feature requests**) or if you want some recipe to be improved (**bug report**)!

Happy cooking - happy gitting!
