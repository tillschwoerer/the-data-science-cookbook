# The Ultimate Egusi Soup


![Egusi and Eba](../img/egusi.png)


### A Taste of Nigeria 

The only thing that comes into my head after a long day of classes is egusi soup with 'plenty passengers'. It has a nutty taste that makes me feel like a good night's rest is assured and can be paired with a swallow or rice.

> **Note**: "Plenty passengers" is a Nigerian slang for a generous mix of fish and meat in a soup.
