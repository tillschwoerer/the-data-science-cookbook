# Nasi Goreng (Indonesian Fried Rice)

Nasi Goreng is a popular Indonesian dish. It could be found like literally everywhere and whenever in Indonesia.

It is basically a fried rice, traditionally served with a fried egg or sunny side egg. In some restaurant it could also be found served with meat, onion or other vegetables.

The thing that distinguishes it from other fried rice dishes is the sauce is made with sweet soy sauce, so that it has unique dark brown and caramelised colour.

I love this dish because the recipe is so simple and it tastes amazing. It is one of my comfort foods, whenever i miss my homecountry.
