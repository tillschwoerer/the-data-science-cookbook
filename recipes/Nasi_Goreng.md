# Nasi Goreng (Indonesian Fried Rice)

Nasi Goreng is a popular Indonesian dish. It could be found like literally everywhere and whenever in Indonesia.
It is basically a fried rice, traditionally served with a fried egg or sunny side egg. In some restaurant it could also be found served with meat, onion or other vegetables.
The thing that distinguishes it from other fried rice dishes is the sauce is made with sweet soy sauce, so that it has unique dark brown and caramelised colour.
I love this dish because the recipe is so simple and it tastes amazing. It is one of my comfort foods, whenever i miss my homecountry.

## Stats
- Prep Time: 10 Minutes
- Cooking Time: 15 Minutes
- Serves: 2 Serving

## Ingredients
- 500gr cooked cold rice
- 3 medium cloves garlic 
- 2 large fresh chili
- half sliced Onion
- 1/2 teaspoon shrimp paste
- 30ml cooking oil
- 2 tablespoon sweet soy sauce and soy sauce
- 2 pinch of salt and white pepper
- 2 sunny side eggs
- 4 slices of cucumber
- 4 slices of tomatos


## Instructions
1. Before starting, ensure you have 500g of cooked, cold rice ready. I recommend using long-grain Jasmine rice, cooked and refrigerated at least one day prior for the best texture. Prepare all other ingredients: chop the garlic and fresh chili, and slice the onion.
2. Heat oil in a large wok or skillet over high heat until shimmering. Add the chopped garlic, chili, sliced onion and shrimp paste. Cook all the together, stirring constantly and scraping bottom of wok or pan to prevent paste from burning.
3. Add rice to wok and stir to coat with spice paste. Add sweet soy sauce and soy sauce. Stir and cook until rice is evenly colored and hot throughout. Season with salt and white pepper.
4. Divide rice between two plates and top each plate of rice with a fried egg. Garnish with cucumber and tomato slices, if you like. Serve immediately with sweet soy sauce alongside for drizzling.
