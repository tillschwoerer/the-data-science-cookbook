# Mousse Au Chocolat
Mousse Au Chocolat is not only a french classic but a standard dish that my family eats every year for christmas. Lucky for us our family recipe is not only very delicious (source: everyone) but easy to make as well. It has never failed me.

## Stats
- 14 hours (good things take time)
- Servings: Around 6ish

## Ingredients
- 600 g Whipped Cream (can't be substitued by vegan alternatives, I am sorry it will not reach a mousse texture)
- 200 g Dark Chocolate (around 50%) (It is key to buy GOOD chocolate, otherwise the mousse will not taste good. Don't buy cheap chocolate!!!)
- 100 g Milk Chocolate (around 25%) (It is key to buy GOOD chocolate, otherwise the mousse will not taste good. Don't buy cheap chocolate!!!)
- Sugar
- Brandy (I don't believe in expensive alcohol, so you can be cheap here.)
- Orange

## Instructions
- Chop the chocolate
- Carefully heat cream in a pot on low heat and add the chopped chocolate, make sure to keep stirring so the cream won't burn.
- Stir everything until the chocolate has incorporated completely into the cream. This will take longer than you think. It should look like thick hot chocolate.
- Once the chocolate has melted, add sugar by taste. It should taste like a hot chocolate that is kind of nice but also kind of too sweet. It should be a little too sweet for your taste, because later the brandy will reduce the sweetness.
- Put the cream-chocolate-mixture into a pot and put it in the fridge overnight. It should be kept in the fridge for at least 4-6 hours. It will become very thick.
- Take the cold, thickened mixture out of the fridge and use a hand mixer to whip the mixture into a mousse. 
- Afterwards add brandy and fresh orange juice to taste. Carefully fold it into the mousse with a spatula. Be careful with the brandy, around one tablespoon should be a good starting point!
- ENJOY!
