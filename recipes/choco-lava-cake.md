# Choco Lava Cake

**Author:** Dory Ratna Harshitha Adidela  
**Time:** 20–25 min  
**Serves:** 4 small cakes

## Ingredients
- 100 g dark chocolate (chopped)
- 80 g butter
- 2 eggs
- 2 tbsp sugar
- 2 tbsp all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp cocoa powder (for dusting ramekins)
- Pinch of salt
- Butter for greasing

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 200 °C. Grease 4 small ramekins and dust with cocoa.
2. Gently melt chocolate and butter (microwave short bursts or bowl over hot water). Cool 1–2 min.
3. Whisk eggs, sugar, and a pinch of salt just to combine (don’t foam).
4. Stir in the melted chocolate mixture. Add in flour and fold until smooth.
5. Divide batter into ramekins.
6. Bake 8–10 minutes: edges set, centers still soft.
7. Rest 1 minute, loosen edges, invert onto plates. Dust cocoa / add ice cream.

## Tips & Notes
- For extra gooey centers, chill filled ramekins 10 minutes before baking.
- Use 60–70% dark chocolate for best flavor.
