**Author:** Dory Ratna Harshitha Adidela  
**Time:** 20–25 min  
**Serves:** 4 small cakes

## Ingredients
- 100 g dark chocolate (chopped)
- 80 g butter
- 2 eggs
- 2 tbsp sugar
- 2 tbsp all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp cocoa powder (for dusting ramekins)
- Pinch of salt
- Butter for greasing

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 200 °C. Grease 4 small ramekins and dust with cocoa.
2. Gently melt chocolate and butter (microwave short bursts or bowl over hot water). Cool 1–2 min.
3. Whisk eggs, sugar, and a pinch of salt just to combine (don’t foam).
4. Stir in the melted chocolate mixture. Sift in flour and fold until smooth.
5. Divide batter into ramekins (about ¾ full).
6. Bake 8–10 minutes: edges set, centers still soft.
7. Rest 1 minute, loosen edges, invert onto plates. Dust cocoa / add ice cream.

## Tips & Notes
- For extra gooey centers, chill filled ramekins 10 minutes before baking.
- Use 60–70% dark chocolate for best flavor.
