# Breakfast Bowl 🥣🍓🌅
A nutrient dense breakfast bowl packed with protein, healthy fats, fiber and tons of flavour for happy mornings! ☀ If I have no time in the morning to prepare it, I usually miss it so much that I'll make it for dinner...

## Stats
- Preparation Time: 10-20 minutes (put dry ingredient in jars in a tray/box for super speed)
- Servings: 1 big bowl

## Ingredients
- 200-250g organic skyr or low fat quark

Base layer: 
- 1 heaped tbsp. chia seeds/ground flax seeds
- 1 heaped tbsp. protein powder of your choice (plant based vanilla/cinnamon recommended)
- 7-8 tbsp. plant-based milk (soy for extra protein)
- ceylon cinnamon to taste

Fruits & Berries:
- 1/2 banana
- 1/2 apple
- 1/2 kiwi
- a handful frozen raspberries
- go crazy here, these are my basic go-tos

Toppings:
- a handful roasted (!) nuts (try which you like)
- anything small and crunchy (hamp seeds, cocoa nibs, coco flakes, roasted buckwheat, ...)
- 2 tsp. of nutbutter (more if it's one of "those" days)
- a sprinkle of granola
- 2 brazil nuts as decor and for you thyroid ;)

## Instructions
- Find the prettiest bowl in your cupboard 🥣✨.
- (optional: Take frozen raspberries out of the freezer and let them thaw a little. I skip this, because they don't contain that much water, thus are edible frozen – and who's got time for that, right?)

1. Base layer:
- Add all dry base layer ingredients into the bowl.
- Add plant-based milk while stiring until it is smooth and creamy. 🧑‍🍳
- Put organic skyr/low fat quark on top.
- Cover the skyr/quark mountain in cinnamon.

2. Fruits:
- Cut fruits into small chunks/slices/pieces.
- Decorate around the quark/skyr island. 🏝️
- Add berries as well.

3. Toppings:
- Sprinkle roasted nuts and small crunchies of your choice on top.
- Spread/drizzle nut butter with a tea spoon (my go-to patterns: swirl 🌀 or zebra stripes 🦓)
- Granola at last, so it doesn't get mushy.
- Finish up with two brazil nuts on the peak of bowl-mountain 🏔️.

Et voilà!🤌 Best served with a large cup of coffee. ☕️
