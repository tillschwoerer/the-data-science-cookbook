# Käsespätzle

I am originally from Baden-Württember, in the south of Germany. This region is famous for a lot of great things: e.g. Mercedes, Porsche, Jürgen Klinsmann, the saying "Wir können ALLES außer Hochdeutsch", cleaning garbage bins from the inside, the sticker "Not bad - but have you ever been to Baden-Württemberg" (which you can find at all major tourist attractions in the world),+  ... and last but not least delicious food such as **Käsespätzle**: it consists of small egg noodles (Spätzle) mixed with cheese and topped with fried onions. It is a very hearty and filling dish, perfect for cold winter days.

Though it is possible to just buy (fresh or dried) **Spätzle** in any supermarket, I would recommend to make your own Spätzle for the full experience.
