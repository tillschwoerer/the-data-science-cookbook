# Käsespätzle

I am originally from Baden-Württember, in the south of Germany. This region is famous for a lot of great things: e.g. Mercedes, Porsche, Jürgen Klinsmann, the saying "Wir können ALLES außer Hochdeutsch", cleaning garbage bins from the inside, the sticker "Not bad - but have you ever been to Baden-Württemberg" (which you can find at all major tourist attractions in the world),+  ... and last but not least delicious food such as **Käsespätzle**: it consists of small egg noodles (Spätzle) mixed with cheese and topped with fried onions. It is a very hearty and filling dish, perfect for cold winter days.

Though it is possible to just buy (fresh or dried) **Spätzle** in any supermarket, I would recommend to make your own Spätzle for the full experience.

## Stats
- Cooking Time: 45 minutes
- Servings: 4

## Ingredients
- 6	eggs
- 500 g of flour 
- 1 tablespoon of oil
- 250 ml of whater
- salt
- 3 medium-sized onions
- 300 g shredded Emmentaler cheese

## Instructions
1. For the dough, mix the eggs, flour, oil and plenty of salt (approx. 4 teaspoons) with a dough hook. Depending on the size of the eggs, add water until you have a thick batter.
2. In the meantime, bring salted water to the boil. Then spread some dough on a board and scrape small pieces into the water with a knife. Alternatively, you may use a "Spätzlepresse" for this. Once the Spätzle rise to the top of the water (does not take long) you can fish them out, e.g. with a slotted spoon.
3. Peel and slice the onions. Fry them in a pan with some oil until they are golden brown.
4. In a large ovenproof dish, layer Spätzle, cheese and onions. Start with Spätzle and end with cheese.
5. Bake in the oven at 200°C for about 15 minutes until the cheese is melted and slightly browned.
